Recently, our dpCoA tagSeq method has been commented by Prof. Jeppe Vinther. We express our gratitute to Jeppe for his check on our bioinformatic analysis and pointing out the defects in our analysis results.     
Here are the links for the [comment](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c04631) and [our response](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/epdf/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c05281).
