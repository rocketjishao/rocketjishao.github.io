The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2023 is awarded to the work on mRNA vaccine, which replaces uridine with pseudo-uridine in mRNA sequence, and it shows much milder immunue responses.   
Recently, there are several crucial papers showing the roles RNA cappings play to mediate immune responses.
